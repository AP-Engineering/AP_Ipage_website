Our SCADA system was failing and though some of the specific equipment was unfamilier to him, it took him very little time to research and understand it. He was able to get us back up and running and make improvements. He was also able to provide a great deal of training and education for myself so that I could do small adjustments that otherwise would have required a call out to a remote location. I really look forward to continuing to work with Cliff.</div>

                          <div class="quote">Cliff is an automation professional who gets results. I appreciate his accountability, punctuality, creativity, and attention to detail. In working at a busy Pulp and Paper Mill to minimize downtime on about 20 critical HMI interface replacements, he created a backwards/forwards compatible, scalable system for imaging stock PCs to create replacement HMIs at a fraction of the former cost. This was accomplished in a manner that enabled a non-technical person to follow well-documented, clear procedures for keeping the system alive in the long term.</div>

His understanding of our processes has increased dramatically as well, which helps everyone communicate better at the worksite.</div>

We could have been in real trouble if you hadn’t been so efficient with reprogramming the PLC and getting all three well pumps to run together. Your thoughts and ideas were constructive aninstrumental in figuring out solutions to the problem and ultimately getting the water flowing again before the busy long weekend.</div>
